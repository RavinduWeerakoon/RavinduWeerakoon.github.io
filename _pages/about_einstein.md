Hi! Iâ€™m a third-year undergraduate at the Department of Computer Science and Engineering, University of Moratuwa. 

My passions lie in Data Science, Computer Vision, Natural Language Processing, and Web Developement. 

In my free time, I love watching cartoons, especially Scooby-Doo, and playing my guitar. 

To keep my walletðŸ’° from feeling lonely, I moonlight as a freelancer on [Upwork](https://www.upwork.com/freelancers/~0151446b458e40eef4).
